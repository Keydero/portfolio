    I’m a student web developer living in Brie-Comte-Robert. I spent eight months  studying at Epitech - Web@académie with my hands in many different areas of web development from back end programming (PHP, Symfony, Laravel) to front end engineering (HTML, CSS, and jQuery/Javascript, VueJs), digital accessibility, user experience and visual design.
